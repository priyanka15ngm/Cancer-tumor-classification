Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women and these cancer cells usually form a tumor,there are two type of tumors bening(Non-cancerous) and malignant(cancerous).In this project we classify malignant and benign tumor and predict whether the patient has breast cancer or not using various Supervised machine learning algorithms.
